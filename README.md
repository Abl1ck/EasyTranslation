## Why you might need it
To avoid long preparation of error messages that you should use in your website or application, EasyTranslation can be used and saves your time.

In addition to this, EasyTranslation offers the ability to format your Exceptions messages to JSON format.

## A Simple Example
```php
<?php
// Import EasyTranslation namespace at the top of your script,
// to prevent the execution error
use EasyTranslation\EasyTranslation\EasyTranslation;

include('src/EasyTranslation.php');

class Example extends EasyTranslation{

    public function __construct() {
		$this->setLanguage();	// Set a language or by default will check for client language (e.g. French is "fr")
		echo $this->translate('Welcome');
    }
}

new Example();
```

You will find more examples at the [examples](https://github.com/Easysoft-cd/EasyTranslation/tree/master/exemples) folder

## Localization
EasyTranslation defaults to English, but in the [language](https://github.com/Easysoft-cd/EasyTranslation/tree/master/exemples/languages) folder you will find 3 translations for the error messages provided by EasyTranslation. Their filenames contain first two characters of [ISO 639-1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-1) language code for the translations, for example `fr` for French. To specify a language, you need to tell EasyTranslation which one to use, like this:

```php
// To load the French version
$this->setLanguage('fr');
```

To load client or defaulft English version
```php
// To load the client or English version
$this->setLanguage();
```

We welcome corrections and new languages.
