To avoid long preparation of error messages that you should use in your website or application, EasyTranslation can be used and saves your time.

In addition to this, EasyTranslation offers the ability to format your Exceptions messages to JSON format.

## A Simple Example
```php
<?php
// Import EasyTranslation namespace at the top of your script,
// to prevent the execution error
use EasyTranslation\EasyTranslation\EasyTranslation;

include('src/EasyTranslation.php');

class Example extends EasyTranslation{

    public function __construct() {
		$this->setLanguage();	// Set a language or by default will check for client language (e.g. French is "fr")
		echo $this->translate('Welcome');
    }
}

new Example();
```
